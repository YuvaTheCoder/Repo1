/* Below is the Question :
 *Given an integer array nums, return true if you can partition the array into two subsets such 
 that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or false otherwise.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
 */

/* Tips :
 * First add all the array elements, if it is Even, there is a possible way we can spli but not sure
 * If the sum is odd, we can't split in two subset
